# Librarr

Self-hosted book, audiobook, webnovel, and manga/webcomic search and download manager. Searches multiple sources, downloads via direct HTTP or torrents, and auto-imports into your library.

## Legal & Educational Use

Librarr is intended for personal archival, research, and educational use.

- **Free sources work out of the box** — Project Gutenberg, Open Library, Standard Ebooks, and Librivox provide thousands of legally free books with no configuration needed.
- **Prowlarr integration** — intended for use with content you have legal access to (e.g. your own rips, public trackers for public domain works, or content you have purchased).
- **Users are responsible** for complying with copyright law in their jurisdiction. Copyright law varies by country.
- **The developers do not condone copyright infringement.** Do not use Librarr to download books you do not have the right to access.

## What It Does

Librarr searches for books across multiple sources simultaneously and downloads them through whatever method is available:

| Source | Type | Config Required |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| Anna's Archive | Direct EPUB download | None |
| Project Gutenberg | Public domain EPUBs | None |
| Open Library | Public domain EPUBs via Internet Archive | None |
| Standard Ebooks | High-quality public domain EPUBs | None |
| Web Novel Sites (7 sites) | Scrape chapters to EPUB | None (lncrawl for scraping) |
| Prowlarr Indexers | Torrent search | Prowlarr |
| AudioBookBay | Audiobook torrents | None (qBittorrent for download) |
| Librivox | Public domain audiobooks (MP3) | None |
| MangaDex | Manga chapter downloads (CBZ per chapter, merged to volume CBZ) | None |
| Nyaa.si | Manga torrent search | qBittorrent |
| Anna's Archive (CBZ/CBR) | Direct manga CBZ/CBR download | None |
| Prowlarr (manga) | Manga torrent search via your indexers | Prowlarr |

After downloading, books are organized into Author/Title folders and auto-imported into your library apps (Calibre-Web, Kavita, and/or Audiobookshelf). Manga is organized into `MANGA_ORGANIZED_DIR/{Series}/` and imported into Komga and/or Kavita.

## Features

- **Multi-source search** — Anna's Archive, Prowlarr/torrent indexers, AudioBookBay, and 7 web novel sites searched in parallel
- **Manga/webcomic search** — MangaDex, Nyaa.si, Anna's Archive (CBZ/CBR), and Prowlarr manga indexers in a dedicated Manga tab
- **Smart download strategy** — For web novels: checks Anna's Archive for a pre-made EPUB first, falls back to chapter-by-chapter scraping only if needed
- **MangaDex chapter downloads** — Downloads all English chapters as individual CBZ files; merges into volume CBZ when volume grouping is available
- **Link verification** — Validates that Anna's Archive results are actually downloadable before showing them
- **Post-processing pipeline** — Organize files into Author/Title folders, import into multiple library apps, track everything
- **Multi-library import** — Calibre-Web (via calibredb), Kavita (API scan), Audiobookshelf (API scan), Komga (API scan) — enable any combination
- **Library tracking** — SQLite-backed history of every book processed, with duplicate detection across searches
- **Activity log** — Full event feed of downloads, imports, file moves, and errors
- **Audiobook support** — Search and download audiobooks via Prowlarr indexers and AudioBookBay
- **Library browsing** — Browse your ebook and audiobook libraries with cover art directly in the UI
- **All integrations optional** — Works with zero config (Anna's Archive + web novel search + MangaDex), add integrations as you need them
- **Plugin sources** — Add new search sources by dropping a Python file into `sources/` — no core code changes needed
- **Settings UI** — Configure all integrations from the web interface with connection testing
- **Persistent downloads** — Download state survives container restarts (SQLite-backed)
- **Dark UI** — Clean, responsive web interface

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/JeremiahM37/librarr.git
cd librarr

# Copy and edit the config
cp .env.example .env

# Run with Docker Compose
docker compose up -d
```

Open `http://localhost:5000` — Anna's Archive and web novel search work immediately with no configuration.

## Docker

### Build and run

```bash
docker build -t librarr .
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name librarr librarr
```

### Docker Compose (recommended)

See the included `docker-compose.yml` for a ready-to-use setup. Adjust the volume paths to match your media storage.

## Configuration

Configuration can be done two ways:

1. **Settings UI** — Click the Settings tab in the web interface to configure integrations, test connections, and save settings (persisted to `/data/librarr/settings.json`)
2. **Environment variables** — Set env vars in `.env` or `docker-compose.yml` (these override UI settings)

### Integrations

| Integration | What It Enables | Required Env Vars |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Prowlarr** | Torrent search via your indexers | `PROWLARR_URL`, `PROWLARR_API_KEY` |
| **qBittorrent** | Torrent downloads + audiobook downloads | `QB_URL`, `QB_USER`, `QB_PASS` |
| **Calibre-Web** | Auto-import ebooks via calibredb | `CALIBRE_CONTAINER` |
| **Audiobookshelf** | Library browsing, audiobook scan + metadata match | `ABS_URL`, `ABS_TOKEN`, `ABS_LIBRARY_ID` |
| **Kavita** | Ebook and manga import via library scan | `KAVITA_URL`, `KAVITA_API_KEY`, `KAVITA_MANGA_LIBRARY_ID`, `KAVITA_MANGA_LIBRARY_PATH` |
| **Komga** | Manga import via library scan | `KOMGA_URL`, `KOMGA_USERNAME`, `KOMGA_PASSWORD`, `KOMGA_LIBRARY_ID`, `KOMGA_LIBRARY_PATH` |
| **lightnovel-crawler** | Web novel chapter scraping to EPUB | `LNCRAWL_CONTAINER` |

### Minimal Setup (no integrations)

Just run the container — Anna's Archive search and web novel search work out of the box. Downloaded EPUBs are saved to `INCOMING_DIR` (`/data/media/books/ebooks/incoming` by default).

## How Search Works

When you search for a book, Librarr queries all configured sources in parallel:

1. **Anna's Archive** — Searches for EPUB files, verifies each result is actually downloadable by checking libgen mirrors, sorts by file size (largest = most complete)
2. **Project Gutenberg** — Searches 70,000+ public domain ebooks via the Gutendex API, returns results with direct EPUB download links
3. **Open Library** — Searches Internet Archive's public domain collection, downloads EPUBs from archive.org
4. **Prowlarr** — Searches your configured torrent indexers for ebook category results
5. **Web Novel Sites** — Searches FreeWebNovel, AllNovelFull, NovelFull, NovelBin, LightNovelPub, ReadNovelFull, and BoxNovel in parallel, deduplicates results

For audiobook searches:
1. **AudioBookBay** — Scrapes audiobook torrents (requires qBittorrent for download)
2. **Librivox** — Searches 18,000+ free public domain audiobooks, downloads MP3 chapter files directly
3. **Prowlarr** — Searches your torrent indexers for audiobook category results (if configured)

For manga searches (Manga tab):
1. **MangaDex** — Searches MangaDex's public API; direct download of all English chapters as per-chapter CBZ files, merged into volume CBZ when volume data is available
2. **Nyaa.si** — Searches Nyaa's literature/manga category for torrent releases (requires qBittorrent)
3. **Anna's Archive** — Searches for CBZ/CBR files for direct download
4. **Prowlarr** — Searches your configured manga indexers (if configured)

Results are filtered to remove junk (suspicious filenames, zero-seeder torrents, irrelevant titles) and sorted with direct downloads first.

## How Manga Download Works (MangaDex)

When you click Download on a MangaDex result:

1. Fetches the full English chapter list from MangaDex API (all chapters, sorted by number)
2. For each chapter: fetches image server assignment, downloads all page images to a temp dir, zips into `{Series} - Chapter 001.cbz`
3. Saves chapter CBZs to `MANGA_ORGANIZED_DIR/{Series}/`
4. Groups chapters by volume number (from MangaDex metadata) — when all chapters in a volume are downloaded, merges them into `{Series} - Volume 01.cbz`
5. Each CBZ file runs through the pipeline: copied to `KAVITA_MANGA_LIBRARY_PATH/{Series}/` and/or `KOMGA_LIBRARY_PATH/{Series}/`, then triggers library scan in Kavita/Komga

Manga downloaded from Nyaa or Anna's Archive (CBZ/CBR) goes through the same pipeline after the torrent completes or file downloads.

## How Web Novel Download Works

When you download a web novel, Librarr uses a multi-strategy approach:

1. First checks Anna's Archive for a pre-made EPUB of that title (much faster)
2. If found, downloads directly and imports to Calibre
3. If not found, falls back to lightnovel-crawler to scrape all chapters from the source site
4. If one source site fails, automatically tries up to 3 alternative sites
5. Validates the resulting EPUB (checks for corruption, rejects suspiciously small files)
6. Imports to Calibre-Web and triggers Audiobookshelf library scan

## Adding Custom Sources

You can add new search sources by creating a Python file in the `sources/` directory. The app auto-discovers all `Source` subclasses on startup.

### Direct Download Source

For sources that provide direct file downloads:

```python
# sources/example.py
import requests
from .base import Source

class ExampleSource(Source):
    name = "example"           # Unique ID
    label = "Example Site"     # Badge label in UI
    color = "#2ecc71"          # Badge color (hex)
    download_type = "direct"   # Framework manages the download job

    def search(self, query):
        # Return list of result dicts. Each must have "title".
        # Include any fields your download() method needs.
        return [{"title": "My Book", "file_url": "https://..."}]

    def download(self, result, job):
        # Called in a background thread. Update job status as you go:
        job["detail"] = "Downloading..."
        # ... download the file ...
        job["status"] = "completed"
        job["detail"] = "Done!"
        return True
```

### Torrent Source

For sources that return torrent links (downloaded via qBittorrent):

```python
# sources/mytracker.py
from .base import Source

class MyTrackerSource(Source):
    name = "mytracker"
    label = "My Tracker"
    color = "#8e44ad"
    download_type = "torrent"  # Results sent to qBittorrent automatically
    config_fields = [          # Shows in Settings UI, stored in settings.json
        {"key": "api_key", "label": "API Key", "type": "text", "required": True},
    ]

    def search(self, query):
        api_key = self.get_config("api_key")
        # Return results with download_url, magnet_url, or info_hash
        return [{
            "title": "My Book",
            "seeders": 10,
            "size_human": "1.5 GB",
            "download_url": "https://...",
        }]
```

Sources with `config_fields` get a settings section automatically in the UI. Config values can also be set via environment variables: `SOURCE_MYTRACKER_API_KEY`.

See `sources/base.py` for the full API documentation.
